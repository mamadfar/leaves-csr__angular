# Development Approaches and Considerations

This document outlines the approaches taken during the development of the Leave
Management System, future improvements that could be made with more time, and
production-ready considerations.

## How I Tackled the Tasks

### 1. Architecture and Framework Choice

- **Angular 20 with Standalone Components**: Chose the latest Angular version
  with standalone components architecture for better modularity and reduced
  boilerplate
- **Signal-based State Management**: Leveraged Angular's new reactive primitives
  (signals) for efficient state management without external dependencies
- **Service-oriented Architecture**: Separated business logic into dedicated
  services (Auth, Employee, Leave) for better maintainability and testability

### 2. Development Strategy

- **Mobile-first Responsive Design**: Used TailwindCSS utility classes to create
  a responsive layout that works across all device sizes
- **Type-safe Development**: Implemented comprehensive TypeScript interfaces and
  types for all data models (Employee, Leave, Auth, LeaveBalance)
- **Mock Data Approach**: Created realistic mock data services to simulate
  backend functionality, allowing for complete frontend development and testing

### 3. User Experience Focus

- **Role-based Interface**: Dynamically adjusted the dashboard interface based
  on user role (employee vs manager)
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Started with core functionality and progressively
  added features like special leave types and approval workflows
- **Intuitive Navigation**: Single-page dashboard design with tab-based
  navigation for better user experience

### 4. Business Rules Implementation

- **Validation-first Approach**: Implemented comprehensive business rule
  validation including:
  - Future date validation for leave requests
  - Weekend restrictions
  - Overlap detection
  - Special leave advance notice requirements (2 weeks)
  - Pro-rata calculation for part-time employees
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages and
  form validation feedback

### 5. Security Considerations

- **Authentication Guard**: Implemented route protection to ensure only
  authenticated users can access the dashboard
- **Data Isolation**: Ensured employees can only view and manage their own leave
  requests (except managers)
- **Role-based Access Control**: Differentiated functionality between employees
  and managers

### 6. Code Quality and Maintainability

- **Prettier Integration**: Set up code formatting with Prettier for consistent
  code style
- **Component Modularity**: Created reusable components (leave-form) that can be
  easily maintained and extended
- **Clear Documentation**: Comprehensive README.md and detailed MAP.md for
  implementation tracking

## If I Had More Time

### 1. Testing Improvements

- **Comprehensive Unit Tests**: Expand test coverage beyond basic service tests
  to include:
  - Component testing with Angular Testing Library
  - Business logic validation tests
  - Edge cases and error scenarios
- **Integration Tests**: Add integration tests for complete user workflows:
  - Login → Leave Request → Approval flow
  - Leave balance calculations with various scenarios
- **E2E Testing**: Implement end-to-end tests for critical user journeys

### 2. Performance Optimizations

- **Lazy Loading**: Implement route-based lazy loading for better initial load
  performance:
  ```typescript
  {
    path: 'dashboard',
    loadComponent: () => import('./pages/dashboard/dashboard').then(m => m.DashboardComponent)
  }
  ```
- **OnPush Change Detection**: Optimize components with OnPush change detection
  strategy
- **Virtual Scrolling**: For large leave history lists
- **Memoization**: Cache expensive calculations like leave balance computations

### 3. Enhanced User Experience

- **Loading States**: Add skeleton loaders and loading indicators for better
  perceived performance
- **Offline Support**: Implement service workers for basic offline functionality
- **Progressive Web App**: Add PWA capabilities with app manifest and caching
  strategies
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and micro-interactions using Angular
  Animations API
- **Date Picker Enhancement**: Use a more advanced date picker with range
  selection and disabled dates

### 4. Error Handling and User Feedback

- **Global Error Handler**: Implement a global error handler for unhandled
  exceptions
- **Toast Notifications**: Replace browser alerts with elegant toast
  notifications
- **404 and 500 Error Pages**: Custom error pages with helpful navigation and
  error reporting
- **Form Validation Enhancement**: Real-time validation feedback with better UX

### 5. UI/UX Improvements

- **Atomic Design Components**: Create a component library with:
  - Button variants (primary, secondary, danger, etc.)
  - Input components with validation states
  - Card components with consistent styling
  - Modal/Dialog components
- **Design Tokens**: Implement design tokens for consistent theming
- **Dark Mode**: Theme switching capability
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with proper ARIA attributes

### 6. State Management

- **NgRx**: For complex state management if the application grows
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement intelligent caching for API responses
- **Optimistic Updates**: Better user experience with optimistic UI updates

## What I Would Do for a Production App

### 1. Development Workflow and Quality Assurance

- **Husky and lint-staged**: Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement:
  ```json
  {
    "husky": {
      "hooks": {
        "pre-commit": "lint-staged"
      }
    },
    "lint-staged": {
      "*.{ts,html}": ["eslint --fix", "prettier --write"],
      "*.{css,scss}": ["stylelint --fix", "prettier --write"]
    }
  }
  ```
